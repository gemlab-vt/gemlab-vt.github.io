  title={CLoRA: A Contrastive Approach to Compose Multiple LoRA Models},
  author={Tuna Han Salih Meral* and Enis Simsar* and Federico Tombari and Pinar Yanardag},
  abstract={Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) have emerged as a powerful and popular technique in the field of image generation, offering a highly effective way to adapt and refine pre-trained deep learning models for specific tasks without the need for comprehensive retraining. By employing pre-trained LoRA models, such as those representing a specific cat and a particular dog, the objective is to generate an image that faithfully embodies both animals as defined by the LoRAs. However, the task of seamlessly blending multiple concept LoRAs to capture a variety of concepts in one image proves to be a significant challenge. Common approaches often fall short, primarily because the attention mechanisms within different LoRA models overlap, leading to scenarios where one concept may be completely ignored (e.g., omitting the dog) or where concepts are incorrectly combined (e.g., producing an image of two cats instead of one cat and one dog). To overcome these issues, CLoRA addresses them by updating the attention maps of multiple LoRA models and leveraging them to create semantic masks that facilitate the fusion of latent representations. Our method enables the creation of composite images that truly reflect the characteristics of each LoRA, successfully merging multiple concepts or styles. Our comprehensive evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative, demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methodologies, marking a significant advancement in the field of image generation with LoRAs. Furthermore, we share our source code, benchmark dataset, and trained LoRA models to promote further research on this topic.},

  title={MIST: Mitigating Intersectional Bias with Disentangled Cross-Attention Editing in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models},
  author={Hidir Yesiltepe and Kiymet Akdemir and Pinar Yanardag},
  abstract={Diffusion-based text-to-image models have rapidly gained popularity for their ability to generate detailed and realistic images from textual descriptions. However, these models often reflect the biases present in their training data, especially impacting marginalized groups. While prior efforts to debias language models have focused on addressing specific biases, such as racial or gender biases, efforts to tackle intersectional bias have been limited. Intersectional bias refers to the unique form of bias experienced by individuals at the intersection of multiple social identities. Addressing intersectional bias is crucial because it amplifies the negative effects of discrimination based on race, gender, and other identities. In this paper, we introduce a method that addresses intersectional bias in diffusion-based text-to-image models by modifying cross-attention maps in a disentangled manner. Our approach utilizes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, eliminates the need for an additional set of reference images, and preserves the original quality for unaltered concepts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in mitigating both single and intersectional biases across various attributes. We make our source code and debiased models for various attributes available to encourage fairness in generative models and to support further research.},

  title={GANTASTIC: GAN-based Transfer of Interpretable Directions for Disentangled Image Editing in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models},
  author={Yusuf Dalva and Hidir Yesiltepe and Pinar Yanardag},
  abstract={The rapid advancement in image generation models has predominantly been driven by diffusion models, which have demonstrated unparalleled success in generating high-fidelity, diverse images from textual prompts. Despite their success, diffusion models encounter substantial challenges in the domain of image editing, particularly in executing disentangled edits—changes that target specific attributes of an image while leaving irrelevant parts untouched. In contrast, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been recognized for their success in disentangled edits through their interpretable latent spaces. We introduce GANTASTIC, a novel framework that takes existing directions from pre-trained GAN models—representative of specific, controllable attributes—and transfers these directions into diffusion-based models. This novel approach not only maintains the generative quality and diversity that diffusion models are known for but also significantly enhances their capability to perform precise, targeted image edits, thereby leveraging the best of both worlds.},

  title={NoiseCLR: A Contrastive Learning Approach for Unsupervised Discovery of Interpretable Directions in Diffusion Models},
  author={Yusuf Dalva and Pinar Yanardag},
  abstract={Generative models have been very popular in the recent years for their image generation capabilities. GAN-based models are highly regarded for their disentangled latent space, which is a key feature contributing to their success in controlled image editing. On the other hand, diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generating high-quality images. However, the latent space of diffusion models is not as thoroughly explored or understood. Existing methods that aim to explore the latent space of diffusion models usually relies on text prompts to pinpoint specific semantics. However, this approach may be restrictive in areas such as art, fashion, or specialized fields like medicine, where suitable text prompts might not be available or easy to conceive thus limiting the scope of existing work. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to discover latent semantics in text-to-image diffusion models without relying on text prompts. Our method takes a small set of unlabeled images from specific domains, such as faces or cats, and a pre-trained diffusion model, and discovers diverse semantics in unsupervised fashion using a contrastive learning objective. Moreover, the learned directions can be applied simultaneously, either within the same domain (such as various types of facial edits) or across different domains (such as applying cat and face edits within the same image) without interfering with each other. Our extensive experiments show that our method achieves highly disentangled edits, outperforming existing approaches in both diffusion-based and GAN-based latent space editing methods.},

  title={CONFORM: Contrast is All You Need For High-Fidelity Text-to-Image Diffusion Models},
  author={Tuna Han Salih Meral and Enis Simsar and Federico Tombari and Pinar Yanardag},
  abstract={Images produced by text-to-image diffusion models might not always faithfully represent the semantic intent of the provided text prompt, where the model might overlook or entirely fail to produce certain objects. Existing solutions often require customly tailored functions for each of these problems, leading to sub-optimal results, especially for complex prompts. Our work introduces a novel perspective by tackling this challenge in a contrastive context. Our approach intuitively promotes the segregation of objects in attention maps while also maintaining that pairs of related attributes are kept close to each other. We conduct extensive experiments across a wide variety of scenarios, each involving unique combinations of objects, attributes, and scenes. These experiments effectively showcase the versatility, efficiency, and flexibility of our method in working with both latent and pixel-based diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion and Imagen. Moreover, we publicly share our source code to facilitate further research.},

  title={RAVE: Randomized Noise Shuffling for Fast and Consistent Video Editing with Diffusion Models},
  author={Ozgur Kara and Bariscan Kurtkaya and Hidir Yesiltepe and James M. Rehg and Pinar Yanardag},
  abstract={Recent advancements in diffusion-based models have demonstrated significant success in generating images from text. However, video editing models have not yet reached the same level of visual quality and user control. To address this, we introduce RAVE, a zero-shot video editing method that leverages pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models without additional training. RAVE takes an input video and a text prompt to produce high-quality videos while preserving the original motion and semantic structure. It employs a novel noise shuffling strategy, leveraging spatio-temporal interactions between frames, to produce temporally consistent videos faster than existing methods. It is also efficient in terms of memory requirements, allowing it to handle longer videos. RAVE is capable of a wide range of edits, from local attribute modifications to shape transformations. In order to demonstrate the versatility of RAVE, we create a comprehensive video evaluation dataset ranging from object-focused scenes to complex human activities like dancing and typing, and dynamic scenes featuring swimming fish and boats. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments highlight the effectiveness of RAVE in diverse video editing scenarios compared to existing methods.},

  title={Fantastic Style Channels and Where to Find Them: A Submodular Framework for Discovering Diverse Directions in GANs},
  author={Enis Simsar and Umut Kocasari and Ezgi Gulperi Er and Pinar Yanardag},
  abstract={The discovery of interpretable directions in the latent spaces of pre-trained GAN models has recently become a popular topic. In particular, StyleGAN2 has enabled various image generation and manipulation tasks due to its rich and disentangled latent spaces. The discovery of such directions is typically done either in a supervised manner, which requires annotated data for each desired manipulation, or in an unsupervised manner, which requires a manual effort to identify the directions. As a result, existing work typically finds only a handful of directions in which controllable edits can be made. In this paper, we attempt to find the most representative and diverse subset of directions in stylespace of StyleGAN2. We formulate the problem as a coverage of stylespace and propose a novel submodular optimization framework that can be solved efficiently with a greedy optimization scheme. We evaluate our framework with qualitative and quantitative experiments and show that our method finds more diverse and relevant channels.},

  abstract={The manipulation of latent space has recently become an interesting topic in the field of generative models. Recent research shows that latent directions can be used to manipulate images towards certain attributes. However, controlling the generation process of 3D generative models remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a novel 3D manipulation method that can manipulate both the shape and texture of the model using text or image-based prompts such as 'a young face' or  'a surprised face'. We leverage the power of  Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model and a pre-trained 3D GAN model designed to generate face avatars, and create a fully differentiable rendering pipeline to manipulate meshes. More specifically, our method takes an input latent code and modifies it such that the target attribute specified by a text or image prompt is present or enhanced, while leaving other attributes largely unaffected. Our method requires only 5 minutes per manipulation, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with extensive results and comparisons. },

  author={Cemre Efe Karakas* and Alara Dirik* and Eylul Yalcinkaya and Pinar Yanardag},
  abstract={Recent advances in generative adversarial networks have shown that it is possible to generate high-resolution and hyperrealistic images. However, the images produced by GANs are only as fair and representative as the datasets on which they are trained. In this paper, we propose a method for directly modifying a pre-trained StyleGAN2 model that can be used to generate a balanced set of images with respect to one (e.g., eyeglasses) or more attributes (e.g.,  gender and eyeglasses). Our method takes advantage of the style space of the StyleGAN2 model to perform disentangled control of the target attributes to be debiased. Our method does not require training additional models and directly debiases the GAN model, paving the way for its use in various downstream applications. Our experiments show that our method successfully debiases the GAN model within a few minutes without compromising the quality of the generated images.  },

  abstract={The search for interpretable directions in latent spaces of pre-trained Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has become a topic of interest. These directions can be utilized to perform semantic manipulations on the GAN generated images. The discovery of such directions is performed either in a supervised way, which requires manual annotation or pre-trained classifiers, or in an unsupervised way, which requires the user to interpret what these directions represent. Our goal in this work is to find meaningful latent space directions that can be used to manipulate images in a one-shot manner where the user provides a simple drawing (such as drawing a beard or painting a red lipstick) using basic image editing tools. Our method then finds a direction that can be applied to any latent vector to perform the desired edit. We demonstrate that our method is able to find several distinct and fine-grained directions in a variety of datasets.},

  abstract={Recent work such as StyleCLIP aims to harness the power of CLIP embeddings for controlled manipulations. Although these models are capable of manipulating images based on a text prompt, the success of the manipulation often depends on careful selection of the appropriate text for the desired manipulation. This limitation makes it particularly difficult to perform text-based manipulations in domains where the user lacks expertise, such as fashion. To address this problem, we propose a method for automatically determining the most successful and relevant text-based edits using a pre-trained StyleGAN model. Our approach consists of a novel mechanism that uses CLIP to guide beam-search decoding, and a ranking method that identifies the most relevant and successful edits based on a list of keywords. We also demonstrate the capabilities of our framework in several domains, including fashion.},

  abstract={While recent works have shown that it is possible to find disentangled directions in the latent space of image generation networks, finding directions in the latent space of sequential models for music generation remains a largely unexplored topic. In this work, we propose a method for discovering linear directions in the latent space of a music generating Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). We use PCA, a statistical method to transform the input data such that the variation along the new axes is maximized. We apply PCA on the latent space activations of our model and find largely disentangled directions that change the style and characteristics of the input music. Our experiments show that the found directions are often monotonic, global and encode fundamental musical characteristics such as colorfulness, speed and repetitiveness. Moreover, we propose a set of quantitative metrics to describe different musical styles and characteristics to evaluate our results. We show that the found directions decouple content and can be utilized for style transfer and conditional music generation tasks.},

  author={Umut Kocasari and Alara Dirik and Mert Tiftikci and Pinar Yanardag},
  abstract={Pre-trained GANs have shown great potential for interpretable directions in the latent space. The discovery of such directions is often done in a supervised or self-supervised manner and requires manual annotations which limits their application in practice. On the other hand, unsupervised approaches provide a way to discover interpretable directions without any supervision, but no fine-grained attribute can be discovered. Recent work such as StyleCLIP aims to overcome this limitation by leveraging the power of CLIP, a joint representational model for text and images, for text-driven image manipulation. While promising, these methods take several hours of pre-processing or training time, and require multiple text prompts. In this work, we propose a fast and efficient method for text-guided image generation and manipulation by leveraging the power of StyleGAN2 and CLIP. Our method uses a CLIP-based loss and an identity loss to manipulate images via user-supplied text prompts without changing any of the irrelevant attributes. Unlike previous work, our method requires only 12 seconds of optimization per text prompt and can be used with any pre-trained StyleGAN2 model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with extensive results and comparisons to state-of-the-art approaches.},
